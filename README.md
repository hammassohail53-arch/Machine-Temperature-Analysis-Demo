# Machine Temperature Monitoring (Demo)

This is a demo project built using **Python sockets** to simulate machine temperature monitoring.  
A client sends fake temperature data to a server, which receives and displays it.  

⚡ **Note:** This is only a learning demo — no real sensors are connected.  
In real-world, the same concept can be extended using **Arduino / Raspberry Pi** with actual temperature sensors for industrial monitoring.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Run the `server.py` file in one terminal.  
3. Run the `MAchine.py` file in another terminal.  
4. The client will send random temperature data to the server.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (built-in `socket`, `random`, `time`)  
- No external libraries required  

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements
- Connect with Arduino + temperature sensor for real machine data.  
- Display data on a dashboard (Tkinter or Web UI).  
- Save temperature logs in a file/database.
